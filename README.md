by Shadi Khalil, Ronald Lagos, Joshua Shin, and David Zhen

Healthify is a nutrition and fitness tracker which helps users pursue their health goals. Users may keep track of their food consumption in NUTRITION or their exercises in FITNESS. Additionally, they can plan GOALS and share progress to social media.

Healthify was produced using Android Studio and was written in Java and XMLfor CMSC434 - Human-Computer Interaction at the Universityof Maryland, College Park (Spring 2021) The course focused on the principles of UI design and ergonomics with respect to digital software interfaces and technological hardware. The app was a final project for the course. For the assignment, we constructed a functional prototype that could be tested by potential users.

My role in on the project was to coordinate UI graphic design as well as back-end functionality on the Nutrition pages. After deciding on app colors as a team, I designed the menus and a prototype "Log Item" screen to serve as a design template for the app. The apps pages were constructed using XML as this allowed us to create button and input field templates and reuse them throughout the app, maintaining consistency.

For additional information about the form and function of Healthify's features, please refer to the video demonstration below:
